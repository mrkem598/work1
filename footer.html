	<h><strong><center>In this my work I am covering on how to create the best footer!!</center></strong></h>

	<p>Like a document footer, a Web page footer contains information listed at the bottom of the page. The footer is also treated as its own section of the Web page, separate from the header, content and sidebars. The footer is coded in either CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) or HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). The footer is located at the bottom of the Web page and is coded using the appropriate "<footer>" HTML or "#footer" CSS tags. It is treated like a section, similarly to the header or body content, and uses the same coding as those sections. The footer is often coded to be the same width as the webpage content section, but the height varies from website to website. The footer can be coded to be static, appearing the same on all Web pages, or it can change from page to page.The footer is an important section of the website for two reasons. One, it displays pertinent technical information for the computer user. The website author displays the information and chooses the content based on the needs of the website. The footer also serves a great purpose in creating more of a coherent look to the website. This can be accomplished with design, images and media.</p>
